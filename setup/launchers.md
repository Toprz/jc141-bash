#### optional user inteface launchers which can be used with our releases easily

- Running our releases without the use of the provided start scripts falls out of our support.

- For any launcher, you can use [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/) or otherwise [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/) to add banners to your library.

### [Rum](https://github.com/jc141x/rum)

Our own attempt at creating a single purpose launcher which focuses on interface and leaving the configuration to the bash script.

It remains usable but development has stalled due to no active developers.

Programming language: Rust/Svelte

The releases are detected automatically if they exist in a path configured in the launcher.

Programming language: Python

<br>

<div align=center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/fW9Qkr95/4234.png" width="800"/></div>

The releases can be added as 'Native' and selecting the start script as the executable.

Programming language: Vala

<br>

<div align=center><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/6qtVJQ4y/43423.png" width="800"/></div>

When adding a game, place it in ~/.local/share/games as the launcher will look for games there.
